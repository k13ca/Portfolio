            My name is Klaudia, I am an IT engineer and currently studying
            tourism. My experience includes working with various graphic
            programs since early school for my own use, which translates into
            proficiency in their use, ability to create graphics, photo editing
            and drawing. I'm good at Photoshop. Presently, I am improving my
            skills in working with Figma and developing in the field of UX/UI.
            My profession is closely related to creating websites and mobile
            applications. Currently, I have little experience in web
            technologies such as: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React Native
            or MySQL. I want to gain commercial experience in any field. I care
            about developing and improving the above-mentioned skills.
